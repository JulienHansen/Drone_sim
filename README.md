# Drone_sim
Hi ! I made this repo to document my journey through RL and drone control / simulation. I will try my best to improve each part starting with just a basic version of a drone and dummy control/physics then going over multiple aspects of RL to end it with Multiagent adversarial environment:

- Part 1: in this folder, you can control a first version of a drone, i quickly did this code to learn about URDF file and robot modelling as well as getting a hand on pyBullet.
