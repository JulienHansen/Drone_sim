# Drone Control and Reinforcement Learning Journey
Welcome to my journey through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and drone control/simulation. This repository documents my progress as I explore various aspects of drone modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of multi-agent adversarial environments involving drones.

Part 1: Basic Drone Simulation and Control
In this first part, I developed a basic version of a drone and implemented dummy control and physics to get started with drone simulation using PyBullet. The primary focus was on understanding URDF files, robot modeling, and getting acquainted with the PyBullet environment.
